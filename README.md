This document is meant to be a sort of guidline for how to do your INDA project.

## Licensing
_Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer_

**Pretty much any original creative work you author is automatically protected under copyright law.** By default, this means that you have exclusive rights to the use and distribution of the work; you get to decide who uses your work, how they use it and their means of obtaining it. **No-one can use your work unless you explicitly allow them too.** It's illegal.

Your source code is an original creative work and as such is protected under copyright law. **Hosting it on GitHub does not change this**, in the same way that posting an article on a blog does not grant readers the permission to re-post the article as their own. This means that **you need to explicitly grant others the rights to use and distribute your code** if you want it to be used in other projects (which you do). **You need a software license**.

Of course, you could write your own software license, but licensing is hard and I'm guessing that you're not a lawyer either. Instead you should choose one of the industry standard licenses such as the MIT, Apache or GPL licenses, depending on how you want your code to be used. If you don't know which license to pick, [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com) is a good place to start. Jeff Atwood's article [Pick a License, Any License](http://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/) over on the Coding Horror blog is a good read if you're still not sure.

In summary: It's illegal for others to use your code without a license. Pick a license.
